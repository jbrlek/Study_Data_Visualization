# Study_Data_Visualization
Repository I will use for studying data visusalization 

My plan is to learn data visualization through practice on existing datasets, following aticles, tutorials, courses and books. I will upload my progress as a way of ensuring I stick to it. 

Firstly, I intend to revisit Seaborn and Matplotlib. I have used those in the past but definitely need some brushing up on them as I have not been using them recently (more than a year has passed). 
Secondly, as anything related to human experience is way more interesting if its interactive, I intend to expand my knowledge of libraries enabling interactive graphs.
